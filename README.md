Household waste is a pressing environmental issue. Global solid waste generation is projected to increase by 70% by 2050, as per the World Bank. In Indonesia, we generated around 64 million tons of solid waste in 2020, with a snning, urgent need for effective waste management solutions. Our research found that only 20% of households actively practice creative reuse, while the majority simply dispose of their waste without exploring alternatives. Despite existing waste disposal apps like "Bank Sampah," there is a crucial gap in platforms that prioritize transforming waste into valuable resources. To address this, we developed "Re-Create," an innovative and minimalist mobile application.

Re-Create revolutionizes waste management by identifying reusable waste and offering creative ideas for repurposing. With cutting-edge technology, our app recommends inventive ways to transform waste into practical and valuable products. With Re-Create, you can  unlock creativity simply by capturing an image. We empower individuals to contribute to a sustainable future, tapping into human ingenuity to address environmental challenges. Together, let's unlock creativity and build a more sustainable world, one discarded item at a time.
Machine Learning: Collecting Trash Images from various resources, annotate them with roboflow and convert them into tfrecord format. Configure server with conda environment to be able to run Tensorflow Object Detection API. Create the training pipeline and Train the data downloaded from roboflow  into a computing server. Freeze the weights and convert them into tflite format. Create a python script to add metadata to the tflite model.
Mobile Development: Deployment of TensorFlow lite and creating both user and an admin app. Application is using CameraX to detect object using tflite and retrofit for integrating between mobile and backend API.
Cloud Computing: Develop and deploy the backend API for the application. Create the documentation
Although we only have a few feature, but we have already planned to add some features in future to incorporate our app into bigger one such as gamification , subscription models and marketplace.
